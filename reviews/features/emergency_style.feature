Feature: Add a styling to the emergency page
As a user
So that I can see better looking emergency info
I want to add classes and ids to elements

Scenario: Test for header
    Given I am on the emergency page
    Then I should see class "emergency-background"
    Then I should see class "header1"

    Then I should see class "flex-container"
    Then I should see class "column_1"
    Then I should see class "column_2"
    Then I should see class "column3"
    Then I should see class "column4"
    Then I should see class "column5"
    Then I should see class "column6"
    Then I should see class "column7"
    Then I should see class "column8"
    Then I should see class "column9"
    Then I should see class "column10"
